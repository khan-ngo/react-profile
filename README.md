# Personal Resume

This repo is an online version of my resume. I made with React as I learn pass props between components. This project gave me an opportunity to experiment with CSS, breakpoints, and gradients.

Let me know what you think!

## Getting started
- `npm install`
- `npm start` to start a dev server

## What I used
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) my editor of choice
- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for hosting on github
- [Additional help to deploy React App to GitHub](https://dev.to/yuribenjamin/how-to-deploy-react-app-in-github-pages-2a1f)
